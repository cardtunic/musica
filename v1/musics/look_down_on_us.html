            <p>Take the food out our hands how much more until we starve?</p>
            <p>Depleted our community the truth is always hard</p>
            <p>Swallow pills knock them back to manage our emotions</p>
            <p>Corporations profit hard then cackle like some vultures</p>
            <p>Picking bones through their teeth caught between the meat</p>

            <p>When a culture is oppressed, we dress up all our trauma</p>
            <p>The truth is hard to find hidden deep within ones aura</p>
            <p>Looking up above instead of looking within ourselves</p>
            <p>My universe works mentally, my body is a shell</p>
            <p>So why so much division has the joy all left our heads?</p>
            <p>Maybe it's the fear of having no one in in our beds</p>
            <p>
              It's empowering to think that all the hateful people out there
            </p>
            <p>
              If they were only shown more love, they wouldn't be so spiteful
            </p>
            <p>Love is my God, I don't care what you say</p>
            <p>All the hate in our hearts, it takes us further away</p>
            <p>From the truth that we keep, but we swallow it down</p>
            <p>Like that lump in your throat when you can't make a sound</p>
            <p>I wanna say you are powerful mighty as a God</p>
            <p>Disconnected love got us always acting up</p>
            <p>Hand me down traumas no evolving from our pain</p>
            <p>Never speaking up has got us always feeling tame</p>
            <p>So take a look around you, a spirit in us all</p>
            <p>Dampened eyes that say, this world can be so cruel</p>
            <p>A that cry washes down, we're fearful just to feel it</p>
            <p>Always looking down on others depleted how we're healing</p>
            <p>Turn pain to power put faith in love</p>
            <p>Be firm and loyal in yourself put trust</p>
            <p>Be twice the ocean be twice the land</p>
            <p>Be twice the water for your sons and daughters</p>
            <br />
            <p>And love</p>
            <p>Love</p>
            <p>Love</p>
