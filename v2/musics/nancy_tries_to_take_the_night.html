        <p>There's a time and a place and the place it is now</p>
        <p>Take the smile off your face when you're dressed like a cow</p>
        <p>When you're frolicking round, legs in the air</p>
        <p>Smile on your face but it's covered in hair</p>
        <p>Do you want it?</p>
        <p>Do you want it?</p>
        <br />
        <p>You run through the streets like the whore that you are</p>
        <p>And you hope pretty soon you'll be struck by the car</p>
        <p>But the light of the day tries to keep you afloat</p>
        <p>While there's pain in your stomach and pain in your throat</p>
        <p>Do you want it?</p>
        <p>Do you want it?</p>
        <br />
        <p>Mother would you take me, and on, and on</p>
        <p>For I have nothing, no more baby, she's gone, and on</p>
        <br />
        <p>I tried to take your word on what you said</p>
        <p>I tried to take the word but the word was dead</p>
        <p>I did not want it</p>
        <p>And in the light of day it all seemed well</p>
        <p>Or was it just a dream, she could not tell</p>
        <p>With how she wanted it?</p>
        <br />
        <p>There's a time and a place and the place it is now</p>
        <p>Take that smile off your face when you're dressed like a cow</p>
        <p>When you're frolicking round with your legs in the air</p>
        <p>Smile on your face but it's covered in hair</p>
        <p>Do you want it? Oh</p>
        <p>Do you want it? Oh</p>
        <br />
        <p>Just imagine a life as a baby and wife</p>
        <p>What the times would look like when compared to the night</p>
        <p>But the money's not there so you sit in despair</p>
        <p>Curse at the sky with a cry, "It's not fair"</p>
        <p>Do you want it? Oh now</p>
        <p>Do you want it? Oh</p>
        <br />
        <p>The rapture of the autumn eve lead to a fate no-one believed</p>
        <p>Taken to the table where she wrote, she held herself a vote</p>
        <p>
          A vote between the good and bad, with all she'd seen and all she'd had
        </p>
        <p>
          Nancy tried to take the night, but now she's gone removed from sight
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>And now oh, mother would you take me, and on, and on</p>
        <p>For I have nothing but my baby, she's gone, and on</p>
        <br />
        <p>If I could take it back now</p>
        <p>Would I take it back now?</p>
        <p>If he could take it (yeah) back (mm) now</p>
        <p>Would he take it all back now?</p>
        <br />
        <p>Nancy took the night and she's gone, and on</p>
