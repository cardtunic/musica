        <p>You’re all grown up</p>
        <p>You have your own stove</p>
        <p>And your own pair of oven gloves</p>
        <p>You have arrangements and assignations</p>
        <p>You keep up appearances and have a reputation</p>
        <p>You sit in the park and work on your sonnets</p>
        <p>You talk about yourself in the past tense</p>
        <p>You have opinions that can’t be shaken</p>
        <p>And morals firm</p>
        <br />
        <p>Do you know what I mean? Do you know what I mean?</p>
        <p>Do you know what I mean? Do you know what I mean?</p>
        <p>Do you know what I mean? Do you know what I mean?</p>
        <p>Do you know what I mean? Do you know what I mean</p>
        <p>Is your favourite turn of phrase</p>
        <p>You know what I mean, you know what I mean</p>
        <p>You know what I mean, you know what I mean</p>
        <p>Is your second favourite turn of phrase</p>
        <br />
        <p>You can speak English better than anyone</p>
        <p>And you can curse like no one ever has done</p>
        <p>And you have a bigger dick than any man who’s ever lived</p>
        <p>And you can cum more than a hundred stallions</p>
        <p>In a room that smells of cigarettes and carrion</p>
        <p>Under sheets freezing cold with damp</p>
        <p>You voyage far and wide across plain and ocean</p>
        <p>Steppe and marsh on celestial bridges</p>
        <p>And knock down doors and climb in windows</p>
        <p>
          And listen in, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Can you hear that?</p>
        <p>The signs of life?</p>
        <p>Not yet awake?</p>
        <p>The stirring, the screwing up of eyes?</p>
        <br />
        <p>A blanket that forms mountains</p>
        <p>The valley between knee and cheek</p>
        <p>The steep slide down to the feet</p>
        <p>The toe poking out, be careful, don’t touch!</p>
        <p>Have discipline, my boy, just watch, stay outside, stay outside</p>
        <p>In the cold</p>
        <p>Can you feel it, you can feel it, you can feel it</p>
        <p>See? There’s a universe in this room</p>
        <p>You scrounger of toilets and pillager of tombs</p>
        <p>You don’t have to work because working is for schmucks</p>
        <p>You know God will light your way</p>
        <p>You are ready to admit to murder, to assault</p>
        <p>To robbery, to pederasty, to fraud</p>
        <p>You are ready to take the blame for every crime of all men</p>
        <p>But the jury is out to lunch</p>
        <br />
        <p>You imagine the roaming camera that captures your melancholy</p>
        <p>You walk the streets that stink of disease</p>
        <p>You turn up your collar like James Dean</p>
        <p>You put your right hand under your jacket</p>
        <p>And pretend you have a gun</p>
        <p>You put your left hand under your jacket</p>
        <p>And pretend you’re Napoleon</p>
        <p>You squeeze your spots till they bleed</p>
        <p>You turn your face so no one sees</p>
        <p>Do beggars still play accordions?</p>
        <p>You should pay one to follow you around and play your theme</p>
        <br />
        <p>Soon your nails will sing</p>
        <p>Soon your earrings will ring</p>
        <p>Soon your organs will grow little mouths</p>
        <p>And speak for themselves</p>
        <p>Soon your body will stage a civil war</p>
        <p>Soon your heart will burst out free</p>
        <p>And soon it will look you in the face and ask</p>
        <p>What have you done?</p>
        <p>Why have you led it astray?</p>
        <p>Soon your brain will migrate</p>
        <p>Soon your balls self-castrate, your feet will scuttle off</p>
        <p>Your hands will fly away</p>
        <p>Soon your eyes will glue themselves shut</p>
        <p>Soon your legs refuse to hold you up</p>
        <p>So embarrassed to bear your name</p>
        <p>Your body will vanish out of shame</p>
        <br />
        <p>The first step is acceptance</p>
        <p>Admit you have no idea what you are doing</p>
        <p>Admit you have no name and no ambition</p>
        <p>Admit that you sleepwalk through life</p>
        <p>Admit that you sleep only sleepless nights</p>
        <p>Admit your best dreams involve being carried</p>
        <p>That spirit that enters your room</p>
        <p>Those arms that envelop poor you!</p>
        <p>That carry you away</p>
        <p>In those arms you escape, you dissolve through clouds</p>
        <p>London shrinks as you leave it behind</p>
        <p>London turns to a model village</p>
        <p>And now you are one with yourself</p>
        <p>You are finally proud</p>
        <p>Admit that you’ve tried to cry and can’t</p>
        <p>Admit to yourself, no one else cares</p>
        <p>There’s no jury present, there’s no reporters</p>
        <p>There’s no examination, it's only you</p>
        <br />
        <p>Soon you’ll disappear</p>
        <p>Soon you won’t be here</p>
        <p>Soon you’ll have all the time in the world</p>
        <p>Soon your lips will unwrap</p>
        <p>Soon your lips will expand</p>
        <p>You’ll pull them apart, up over your head</p>
        <p>Soon you’ll be inside out</p>
        <p>Soon your veins will spring off</p>
        <p>Soon they’ll spread out for miles</p>
        <p>Soon your veins will transport trains all over the world</p>
        <p>Soon your veins will be a railroad</p>
        <p>Soon your mind will extract itself</p>
        <p>And very soon you’ll disappear, soon you’ll disappear</p>
        <p>You’ll be fine, just relax</p>
        <p>Soon you’ll disappear</p>
        <p>That’s the only fact</p>
